# Github Portfolio - Shanta Kurapati

Hello! Thank you so much for visiting my portfolio. Here is a quick overview of the projects in my portfolio:

## Bearmaps

Bearmaps is a simplified version of Google Maps for the City of Berkeley. I executed the backend coding for this project. 
  1. Calculuted the shortest viable path between two user-inputted points using JSON API and the A* search alogrithm
  2. Used Tries for name search autocompletion capabilities
  3. Used quadtrees to support image and map rasterization/zoom
  4. Read in real-life data from the Open Street Map datasets to construct underlying graph database

## Glassdoor Scraper (personal project)

I created a glassdoor scraper for an industry project that prints out the estimated salary given the role, company, and location using Selenium Webdriver.

## NBA Players EDA

I took an open source dataset on NBA Players and performed EDA to create visualizations and built a binary classification model that predicted which team would win if paired for a game using logistic regression. I also built three seperate models to classify whether a player was a center, forward, or guard: one-vs-rest logistic regression, decision trees, and a random forest algorithm. I also minimized mean squared error and cross entropy loss to optimize my model. A more detailed step-by-step description of my project is available in the .py file. 

## Gitlet

Built custom version of git in Java from scratch supporting main functionalities. It mimics git's own hash-based storage system. Supports: init, add, commit, rm, log, global-log, find, status, checkout, branch, rm-branch, reset, merge. It can also track and commit file changes, revert to previous versions, and create branches.
